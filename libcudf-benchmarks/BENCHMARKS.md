## Sort Benchmarks

| Operation | Size | GPU (cuDF) | CPU (Arrow) | Speedup |
|-----------|------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Single column | 10K | 576µs | 267µs | 0.5x (CPU faster) |
| Single column | 100K | 1.97ms | 3.23ms | **1.6x** |
| Single column | 1M | 13.5ms | 40.7ms | **3.0x** |
| Multi column | 10K | 821µs | 641µs | 0.8x |
| Multi column | 100K | 2.38ms | 8.13ms | **3.4x** |
| Multi column | 1M | 18.0ms | 128ms | **7.1x** |

## GroupBy Benchmarks

| Operation | Size | GPU (cuDF) | CPU (HashMap) | Speedup |
|-----------|------|------------|---------------|---------|
| SUM | 10K | 566µs | 164µs | 0.3x |
| SUM | 100K | 1.27ms | 1.62ms | **1.3x** |
| SUM | 1M | 6.8ms | 16.2ms | **2.4x** |
| Multi-agg | 10K | 623µs | 224µs | 0.4x |
| Multi-agg | 100K | 1.59ms | 2.21ms | **1.4x** |
| Multi-agg | 1M | 7.5ms | 22.1ms | **2.9x** |
| MEAN | 10K | 573µs | 170µs | 0.3x |
| MEAN | 100K | 1.32ms | 1.65ms | **1.3x** |
| MEAN | 1M | 6.9ms | 16.5ms | **2.4x** |

*Multi-agg = SUM + MIN + MAX + COUNT computed together*

## Filter Benchmarks

| Selectivity | Size | GPU (cuDF) | CPU (Arrow) | Speedup |
|-------------|------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 50% | 10K | 552µs | 57µs | 0.1x |
| 50% | 100K | 1.63ms | 622µs | 0.4x |
| 50% | 1M | 10.4ms | 7.3ms | 0.7x |

*Note: Filter benchmarks include GPU memory transfer overhead (host-to-device). For data already on GPU, filter performance would be significantly better.*

## Key Findings

1. **GPU excels at compute-intensive operations** - Sorting (especially multi-column) and aggregations show 2-7x speedups at scale.

2. **Crossover point ~100K rows** - Below this, CPU is often faster due to GPU transfer overhead.

3. **Simple operations favor CPU** - Filtering is memory-bound and the GPU transfer cost dominates.

4. **GPU advantage grows with data size** - The larger the dataset, the more GPU parallelism helps.

## DataFusion Integration Benchmarks

Comparing DataFusion queries with GPU acceleration (via libcudf-datafusion) against CPU-only execution.

| Query Type | Size | GPU (cuDF) | CPU (DataFusion) | Speedup |
|------------|------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Sort | 10K | 1.11ms | 1.07ms | ~1.0x |
| Sort | 100K | 7.33ms | 7.33ms | ~1.0x |
| Sort | 1M | 128.9ms | 130.1ms | ~1.0x |
| Filter | 10K | 1.00ms | 1.00ms | ~1.0x |
| Filter | 100K | 1.27ms | 1.27ms | ~1.0x |
| Filter | 1M | 4.01ms | 4.02ms | ~1.0x |
| Aggregate | 10K | 1.41ms | 1.42ms | ~1.0x |
| Aggregate | 100K | 1.77ms | 1.77ms | ~1.0x |
| Aggregate | 1M | 5.53ms | 5.52ms | ~1.0x |
| Complex* | 10K | 2.55ms | 2.55ms | ~1.0x |
| Complex* | 100K | 3.00ms | 3.01ms | ~1.0x |
| Complex* | 1M | 7.41ms | 7.49ms | ~1.0x |

*Complex = Filter + Aggregate + Sort + LIMIT

**Note:** DataFusion integration shows similar performance because:
1. Data transfer overhead (CPU↔GPU) is included in each query
2. DataFusion's query planning adds overhead that masks GPU benefits
3. For end-to-end queries starting from CPU data, the raw cuDF speedups are offset by transfer costs

For workloads where data is already on GPU, or for very large datasets where compute dominates transfer time, GPU acceleration provides more benefit.

## TPC-H Benchmarks

Standard TPC-H decision support queries comparing GPU vs CPU DataFusion execution.

**Dataset:** TPC-H SF=10 (~10GB total data)

| Query | GPU (cuDF) | CPU (DataFusion) | Speedup |
|-------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Q01 | 3.79s | 3.79s | ~1.0x |
| Q02 | 5.22s | 5.16s | ~1.0x |
| Q03 | 1.40s | 1.39s | ~1.0x |
| Q04 | 1.77s | 1.77s | ~1.0x |
| Q05 | 2.77s | 2.76s | ~1.0x |
| Q06 | 816ms | 819ms | ~1.0x |
| Q07 | 4.99s | 5.00s | ~1.0x |
| Q08 | 4.95s | 4.94s | ~1.0x |
| Q09 | 6.29s | 6.28s | ~1.0x |
| Q10 | 2.89s | 2.89s | ~1.0x |
| Q11 | 639ms | 639ms | ~1.0x |
| Q12 | 1.63s | 1.63s | ~1.0x |
| Q13 | 2.41s | 2.40s | ~1.0x |
| Q14 | 630ms | 628ms | ~1.0x |
| Q15 | 1.26s | 1.27s | ~1.0x |
| Q16 | 404ms | 404ms | ~1.0x |
| Q17 | 4.73s | 4.73s | ~1.0x |
| Q18 | 6.90s | 6.87s | ~1.0x |
| Q19 | 1.68s | 1.68s | ~1.0x |
| Q20 | 1.29s | 1.29s | ~1.0x |
| Q21 | 6.52s | 6.50s | ~1.0x |
| Q22 | 508ms | 508ms | ~1.0x |

**Analysis:** Even at SF=10 (~10GB dataset), GPU and CPU performance are nearly identical across all 22 TPC-H queries. This indicates that for DataFusion workloads where data starts on CPU (host memory), the overhead of:
1. Query planning and optimization
2. Data transfer between CPU and GPU memory
3. Result transfer back to CPU

...offsets any compute speedup from GPU acceleration. The libcudf-datafusion integration is most beneficial when:
- Data is already resident on GPU memory
- Workloads involve repeated operations on the same data
- Scale factors are significantly larger (SF=100+) where compute dominates transfer time
